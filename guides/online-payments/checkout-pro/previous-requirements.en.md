# Prerequisites to get started


## Glossary

We know some terms are new. Before getting started, we'll give you a hand.

Term | Description
------------ | -------------
_Preference_ | It is the **information of the product or service that you want to offer.** Among the most important attributes of a preference are defined: the description, the amount and the items. When generating it, you get the URL to start the payment flow.
_Credentials_ | Your credentials are the **keys we provide so you can configure your integrations.**<br/>There are two types:<br/><br/>**Public Key**. Public key of the application to know, for example, the payment methods and encrypt card details. You must use it only for your integrations.<br/>**Access Token**. Private key of the application to generate payments. You must use it only for your integrations.<br/><br/>To find them, go to your <a href="[FAKER][CREDENTIALS][URL]" target="_blank"> credentials </a> and select the productive ones.<br/><br/>
_Initial Point (init_point)_ | **It is the URL obtained at the time of generating the preference** and that starts the payment flow of the Checkout Pro.
_Ítem_ | It refers to the product or service you want to offer. It can be one or a list.
_Application_ | The applications are used to process the seller's payments. **Each application identifies a particular integration**, since each one has its own <a href="[FAKER][CREDENTIALS][URL]" target="_blank"> credentials</a>. One Mercado Pago account can have multiple applications.<br/><br/>You can find the information of each one in Credentials. Upon entering, one will be created automatically or you can <a href="https://applications.mercadopago.com/" target="_blank"> create an application</a> every time you need one.
